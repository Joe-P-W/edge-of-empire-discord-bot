        ## Invite Edge Bot to your discord server
        https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=661273326492188672&permissions=522304&scope=bot
        
        ## Using the bot
        This bot allows you to roll the specialised dice for the Star Wars RPG Edge of Empire.  
        The following dice can be rolled:  
        - Boost Die
        - Set Back Die
        - Difficulty Die
        - Proficiency Die
        - Challenge Die
        - Force Die
        
        The specialised symbols on these dice are as follows:  
        - Success = ✶
        - Fail = ▼
        - Triumph = ⎈
        - Advantage = ℧
        - Despair = ⎊
        - Threat = ⎔
        - Light = ○
        - Dark = ●
        - Blank = ▢
        
        To roll a die, type "/r" followed by any of the following:
        - Boost Die = bd
        - Set Back Die = sbd
        - Difficulty Die = dd
        - Proficiency Die = pd
        - Challenge Die = cd
        - Force Die = fd
        
        To roll more than one of the same die put a number before your die "/r 3fd".
        To roll more than one of a differing dice separate them by a "+" "/r 2fd + 6sbd"
        
        For help at any time type "/help" and the bot will give you instructions
        
        ## Setup Locally
        
        ### Requirements  
        This bot requires Python 3.7 and the discord.py package to install this:
        ```pip install discord.py``` or if you have any problems look at the discord.py page: 
        https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/
        
        ### Set Up
        1. To set it up follow the steps 2, 3 and 4 from:   
         https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/  
        2. Once you have set it up and invited it to the server you need to link it to the python
         files in this repo. To do this take your bot's authorisation token and set it as an 
         environment variable on your machine.
         - To do this search "edit system environment variables" and run this (for windows)
         - Click the environment variables button
         - Click "New" under user variables
         - Set "variable name" to: edge_bot_token
         - Set "variable value" to: the bot's authorisation token you got
         - Apply and okay out of all the menus and restart your PC
         
         Now you will be able to run the "edge_bot.py" file and a terminal should open and print:
         "Bot initialised" when the bot is ready.  
         
         Have fun!
